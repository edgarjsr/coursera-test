        <p>
          This Pokémon is an absolute badass. It's typing (Poison/Ghost) and ability (Levitate) make it inmune to lots of things (Fighting, Normal, Poison and Ground attacks). Also, it got a good speed, being able to revenge kill slower foes with its superb Special Attack.

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">Gyarados
        <p>
          Gyarados is as strong as a tank. It's ability Intimidate makes it an excellent option to face physical based foes. Also, having it's Flying type as a support, Gyarados is able to avoid Ground hits and stop powerful Fighting opponents. Using Leftovers in tandem with Substitute and a defensive set, this Pokémon will surely cause a headache to your friends.

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">Scizor
        <p>
          Scizor is a good option to fight against Fairy-type opponents. It has access to Defog and Roost, so, together with the Scizorite, Mega-Scizor can be a powerful supporter tank. Last but not least, a Bullet Punch coming out of its stellar attack stat will hurt any foe that doesn't resist it.
